                Maintaining a healthy diet doesn't have to be complicated or restrictive.

                The foundation of healthy eating starts with understanding the main food groups and their roles in our body. A balanced diet should include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Each of these components provides essential nutrients that our bodies need to function optimally and maintain good health.

                One of the most effective strategies for healthy eating is the plate method. Fill half your plate with colorful vegetables and fruits, quarter with whole grains, and the remaining quarter with lean proteins. This simple approach ensures you're getting a good balance of nutrients at every meal while maintaining portion control naturally.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Hydration plays a crucial role in healthy eating habits. Water helps transport nutrients throughout your body, regulates body temperature, and aids in digestion. While individual needs vary, aim to drink water throughout the day and limit sugary beverages. A good rule of thumb is to drink water when thirsty and to check that your urine is pale yellow.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Meal planning and preparation are valuable tools for maintaining healthy eating habits. Setting aside time to plan your meals for the week, creating a shopping list, and preparing ingredients in advance can help you make better food choices and avoid the temptation of convenient but less healthy options when you're busy or tired.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Remember that healthy eating is a journey, not a destination. It's okay to enjoy treats in moderation, and it's more important to focus on developing sustainable habits rather than following strict rules. By making small, consistent changes to your eating habits, you can create a healthy relationship with food that supports your long-term health goals.
